# Kolehiyolo's Portfolio
Good day! This is my portfolio showcasing pretty much everything that I've got. From all of my creative skills to my technical ones, this is meant to express that I'm capable of so much more than meets the eye. Think of it as a flex lol.

## Description
This portfolio itself (which is a web project utilizing web design, web development and digital graphics) took so much building and planning to produce, and exhausted so much of my creative juices. I built every single illustration visible and I also built every web functionality seen such as paginators, carousels, burger toggles, forced scrolling behavior, and so much more. I even built the Submaboat's movements and behaviors from scratch.

## Inspiration
The "under-the-sea" theme of the project was mainly inspired by the portfolio project assigned to us students by our instructor Angela Yu from London App Brewery. I've taken her online course from Udemy and a portfolio was one of the beginner projects. She gave us a template of sorts to work with and the hero section had an island and a pair of clouds. That got me to think that yeah adding the "diving" motif would be fun. It's like the deeper you go, the more you know who I am and what I'm capable of. So I went to work with prototyping, but not until I've gotten through so much of the course. Now, I added so much functionalities to the page, such as a "Submaboat" that acts as a POV that follows you as you navigate the page, a neat scrolling behavior to better emulate the Submaboat movement, and each section also has a different style and way of displaying information.
